  (2017)
  * basic contract:
    Σ_M: set of all public names (API)
    R: contract, regex over Σ_M
    ρ: clause, ρ ∈ R
  * contract with parameters: added meta-variables (X, Y, ...) and free
    meta-variable (_)
  * contract with spoilers:
    R: set of target clauses
    ρ: target clause, ρ ∈ R
    S: set of spoilers
    σ: spoiler, σ ∈ S, regex over Σ_M
    Σ_R: methods used in targets, Σ_R ⊂ Σ_M
    Σ_S: methods used in spoilers, Σ_S ⊂ Σ_M
    C: contract, C ⊆ R×S
  * contract violation: r.start, s.start, s.end, r.end
  * dynamis analysis:
    * threads T, targets R, spoilers S, contracts C, locks L
    * event types: thread entering/exiting method, thread acquiring/releasing
      lock, thread forking/joining another thread
    E_t: set of events that can be generated by a thread, t ∈ T
    E: E = ∪_{t ∈ T} E_t
    τ: trace, τ = e_1 ... e_n ∈ E⁺
    start(t), end(t): first/last event generated by a thread
    * trace subsequence is an instance of a target iff
      1. well paired enter/exit events
      2. enter events matches the contract target regex
      3. no other interleaved events from the target alphabet
    * ≺\_hb: happens-before relation over events in a trace, e\_j ≺\_hb e\_k
      holds whenever j < k and one of the following holds
      1. same thread (program order)
      2. acquire/release the same lock
      3. fork/join
    * contract violation: r may start before s and end after s
      start(s) ⊀_hb start(r) ∧ end(r) ⊀_hb end(s)
    * trace window: υ
      υ → e: remove event e from trace window υ
      υ → r: remove all events from r provided they do not belong to another
      tracked instance of a target or spoiler
      υ → s: remove all events from s provided...
    * discarding spoilers:
      * lemma 1: if start(s\_1) ≺\_hb start(s\_2) then s\_1 can be discarded
      * lemma 2: for each thread that started before the end of the window, we
        can keep only the last spoiler instance
    * discarding targets:

  (2015)
  * dynamic analysis instead of static
  * contract detection: finite automata for each thread and observed contract
    sequence
  * checking atomicity: lockset-based, at least one lock must be held during the
    contract sequence
  * false positives and false negatives
* [Preventing atomicity violations with contracts](https://docentes.fct.unl.pt/joao-lourenco/files/1505.02951v1-dsousa.pdf)
  (2015)
  * contract definition
  * analysis:
    1. entry methods of threads
    2. detect atomically executed methods
    3. extract program behavior with respect to the module under analysis
    4. verify thatt the module is used according to the contract
  * program's thread behavior grammar
  * possible mistake in 1st example: missing G -\> H
  * contract verification algorithm
  * adding points-to information (modified grammar)
  * contracts with parameters

  (2012)
* The RoadRunner Dynamic Analysis Framework for Concurrent Programs (2010)
  * introduction:
    * for writing dynamic analysis
    * event handlers for different kind of events
    * composition: different tools can be chained
    * each analysis is a filter over event stream
    * diagnostic tools: print, time, count, record
    * comparation of dynamic analyses
  * API:
    * thread and lock shadows
    * variable shadows
    * events
    * tool composition
  * implementation details: TODO
  * optimizations: TODO

* [Applying “design by contract”](http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/computer/contract.pdf)
  (1992)
  * move away from defensive programming
  * contract = precondition, postcondition, invariant
  * no hidden clauses
  * who should check - client vs. supplier
  * invariants: hold for all observable states
  * inheritance: precondition must be equal or weaker, postcondition equal or
    stronger
  * dynamic binding
  * exception handling
